# Solar-Energy-Single-Axis-Tracking-System
This is my FYP project on Solar Single Axis tracking system.

My system use chronological single axis tracking. A chronological tracking is a passive tracking which tracks the sun based on data programmed in the controller.
Kuala Lumpur sun path data is use to control the motor which tracks the sun for 8 hours.
Real time clock and a gyrometer was used as a feedback for the controller to control the motor.
